# Format String Lab

This is a newly develolped lab. It merges the 32-bit 
and 64-bit versions together into one lab. 
The majority of the tasks are on 32-bit programs,
because it is easier. The last task is on 64-bit programs.
This task is significantly more difficult, so if 
instructors do not want to include this task, they can
make it optional.
