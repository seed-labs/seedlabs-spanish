# SEED Manual for Containers

## Tutorials on Docker
- [A brief tutorial on Docker](./docker.md)
- [Commonly used commands](./docker-commands.md)


## Setting Up Lab Environment Using Docker Compose

In many of the SEED labs, we need several containers;
some labs may need more than 10 containers.
Creating them one by one and setting up their networks become tedious.
Docker provides a tool called Compose, which
simplifies the entire process. All the SEED labs will use
Compose to set up its container-based lab environments.

- [Setting up Multiple Networks](./compose-twolans.md)
- [Building, Starting, and Stopping Containers](./compose-commands.md)
- [Special Settings for Containers](./container-settings.md)


## Working with Containers

We provide manuals to help students who are not familiar with containers.

- [Running Commands inside Containers](./container-execute.md)
- [Packet sniffing inside container](./container-sniffing.md)
- [Finding out network interface name](./container-interface.md)
- [Detaching the VM From a Network](./detaching.md)

## Setting Up A DNS Infrastructure

In some labs, we need to include a DNS infrastructure,
which consists of a local DNS server,
an attacker's nameserver, and an user machine.
This section explains how the DNS environment is set up.
Students can use this section as a reference to understand the setup.

- [Local DNS Server](./dns_local_dns_server.md)
- [Attacker's Nameserver](./dns_attacker_ns.md)
- [User Machine](./dns_user_machine.md)
- [Testing the DNS Infrastructure](./dns_testing.md)


## Common Problems

- [In my country, it is too slow to download docker images](./Problems/docker_hub_issues.md)
- [Many problems are caused by the shared folder](./Problems/shared_folder.md)
- [My "docker-compose up" failed because I forgot to shut down the containers from another SEED lab](./Problems/forget_turn_off.md)
- [Miscellaneous Problems](./Problems/misc_problems.md)
