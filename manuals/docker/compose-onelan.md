# Lab Environment Setup Using Docker Compose

In this manual, we will use Compose to
create a lab environment setup that consists of a LAN
and containers. The setup is depicted in the following
Figure.

## Writing the ```docker-compose.yml``` file

With Compose, we use a YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`
to configure our containers. Then, with a single command,
we can create and start all the containers from your configuration.
The following is an example of the file.

``` yaml
version: "3"

services:
    HostA:
        build: ./ubuntu_base
        image: seed-ubuntu-base-image
        container_name: host-10.9.0.5
        tty: true
        cap_add:
                - ALL
        networks:
            net-10.9.0.0:
                ipv4_address: 10.9.0.5

    HostB:
        image: seed-ubuntu-base-image
        container_name: host-10.9.0.6
        tty: true
        cap_add:
                - ALL
        networks:
            net-10.9.0.0:
                ipv4_address: 10.9.0.6

    HostC:
        image: seed-ubuntu-base-image
        container_name: host-10.9.0.7
        tty: true
        cap_add:
                - ALL
        networks:
            net-10.9.0.0:
                ipv4_address: 10.9.0.7

networks:
    net-10.9.0.0:
        name: net-10.9.0.0
        ipam:
            config:
                - subnet: 10.9.0.0/24

```

Let us explain explain how it works.

- The `services` section lists all the containers that we want to build and run

- The `networks` section lists all the networks that we need to create.
Each network is given a name, and the name is used by the container entries.

- The `build` entry: This entry indicates that the container
image's folder name, and will use the `Dockerfile` inside to build
a container image. If a service does not have a `build` entry,
it means the container does not need to build its own
image; it uses the existing image specified in the `image` entry.
It should be noted that one image can be used by multiple container instances.

- The `image` entry: The name of the image is specified in this entry.
Without this entry, docker will generate a name for this image.

- The `container_name` entry: After building the image,
Compose will start a container instance from this image,
and the name of the container instance is specified in this entry.
In our naming convention,
we attach the IP address to the hostname.

- `tty: true`: Indicate that when running the container, use the
`-t` option, which is necessary for getting a shell prompt
on the container later on.

- The `networks` entry: It specifies the name of the networks that
this container is attached to,
along with the IP address assigned to the container.
Multiple networks can be attached to a container.

**Note**: When Docker creates a network, it automatically
attaches the host machine (i.e., the VM) to the network, and gives
the `.1` as its IP address. Namely, for the
`10.9.0.0/24` network, the host machine's IP address is
`10.9.0.1`. Therefore, the host machine can directly
communicate with all the containers.
